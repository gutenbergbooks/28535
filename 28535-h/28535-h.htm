<p class="pr1"><b><big>An eye-witness account of the 14th World
Science Fiction Convention in session.</big></b></p></div>

<p>I was a spy for the FBI&mdash;the
Fantasy Bureau of Investigation!
Learning of a monster
meeting of science fiction
"fen" in New York, I
teleported myself 3,000 miles
from the Pacificoast to check
the facts on the monsters.
And it was true&mdash;the 14th
World SciFi Con was tremonstrous.</p>

<hr />

<p>In all seriousness, the
<i>Newyorcon</i> was one of the
greatest aggregations of s.f.
enthusiasts I have ever seen.
A far cry from the <i>Nycon</i>,
the <i>first</i> "world" s.f. con of
17 years before, when the
turnout of 125 was considered
colossal. Now more
than twelve hundred fans,
authors, editors, artists, publishers,
agents, anthologists,
reviewers and readers of science
fiction and fantasy registered
for the Labor Day
Weekend gathering of the
clans, a conclave of the slans.</p>

<p>From 37 of the 48 states
they came. And from Canada,
Cuba, England, Germany,
India, Israel and the West
Indies. The roll call of celebrities
read like the Who's
Who of S.F. Prodom: Theodore
Sturgeon, Isaac Asimov,
Fritz Leiber, Willy Ley,
Nelson Bond, John W.
Campbell Jr., L. Sprague de
Camp, James Blish, Judith
Merril, "Ted" Carnell (Editor
of New Worlds), Kelly
Freas, Edmond Hamilton,
Leigh Brackett, Anthony
Boucher, William Tenn,
James E. Gunn, Frank Belknap
Long Jr., and numerous
others, including Guest of
Honor Arthur C. Clarke.</p>

<p>A standing ovation was
given Arthur Clarke before
and after his speech at the
Banquet, a serious address
that lasted forty-five minutes
and covered many philosophical
facets of the s.f. field.
Especially rousing hands
were given two of the real
old-timers present, artist
Frank R. Paul (Guest of
Honor of the first Convention),
and&mdash;out of the Ark&mdash;the
man who once was an assistant
to Thomas Alva Edison,
the pioneer novelist of
scientific romances and the
man who discovered the Golden
Atom&mdash;Ray Cummings.
World famous cartoonist Al
Capp gave a hilarious speech
at the Banquet Sunday night,
other large laughs being
garnered on the occasion by
Isaac Asimov and Anthony
Boucher, Robert Bloch again
proving that he has no peer
as a Master of Ceremonies.</p>

<p>The Masquerade Ball was
filmed for televising, and
was a sight for bugging eyes.
Extraterrestrial glamour girls
came in spectrumatic colors:
one, Ruth Landis of Venus
(formerly Nuyok), was a verdant
beauty, fresh as a breath
of chlorophyll; while tall
Tam Otteson, a recent import
from England, had the
judges agreeing that just
looking at her was an education.
Olga Ley won for the
Most Beautiful costume, and
Jos Christoff&mdash;a survivor
from the first convention of
them all&mdash;was another prize
winner. Monsters, mutants,
scientists, spacemen, aliens,
and assorted "Things"
thronged the ballroom floor
as the flashbulbs popped.</p>

<p>John Campbell lectured on
and demonstrated his controversial
psionic Hieronymus
machine, and famous
fans sprang from der vood-work
out&mdash;Sam Moskowitz,
James Taurasi, Bob Tucker,
Julius Unger, Raymond Van
Houten, Allen Glasser ...</p>

<p>David Kyle, E. E. Evans,
James Taurasi, myself and 2
others were elected Directors
of the World Science
Fiction Society.</p>

<p>No account of the Newyorcon
could be complete
without a deep bow of appreciation
to the altruistic trio
of committeemen (including
one comely woman) who all
but destroyed themselves engineering
the Convention:
David A. Kyle, Ruth Landis
and Dick Ellington.</p>

<p>By a vote of 3 to 1, London
was selected as the site of
the 15th Con, to be held in
'57. For an unforgettable experience
in the fantastic universe
of science fiction enthusiasts,
plan <i>now</i> to attend
the LONCON!</p>
